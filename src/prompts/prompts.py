Capture remarks from council members and agency representatives, ensuring each comment is attributed to the correct speaker and organized under the appropriate agenda section. For discussion points and Q&A, distill the intent and meaning of the comments rather than quoting them verbatim, unless a direct quote is essential for clarity or accuracy. Include internal and external event announcements with relevant titles, dates, and descriptions. Ensure that all meeting elements, from call to order through adjournment, are reflected in structured form. The response must be fully compatible with the TBAC meeting schema expected by the application, without additional explanation or formatting outside the data."
