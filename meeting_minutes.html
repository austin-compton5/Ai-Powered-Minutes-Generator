    <h2>5. Letter from the Sustainability Commission for City Council's Consideration of New Drive-Through Regulations (Action)</h2>
    
        <p><em>Presented by David Nazarian</em></p>
    
    
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> David Nazarian stated that the commission is to submit a letter to the City Council expressing support to revisit a prohibition on new drive-through establishments in the City of Glendale. The letter was presented at the January 13th special meeting, where commission members provided feedback on a draft presented by Commissioner Bartusek. The amended letter is presented for the commission to consider submitting to City Council.</p>
    
    
        <p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> Commissioner Bartusek provided background on the origin and intent of the letter, which was a result of City Council's inability to extend the temporary moratorium on drive-throughs, and the concerns regarding their impact outside of the downtown specific plan area. The letter outlines the implications of drive-throughs on transportation and sustainability initiatives. He detailed changes made to the letter based on requests, including adding specific asks for a moratorium and including exhibits.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> Commissioner Werner thanked Commissioner Bartusek for incorporating the comments well. Adding the image, is worth a thousand words. It brings to mind how alleys have been taken over, and the city doesn't benefit, and the public doesn't benefit. Enforcement for these types of issues is something to address. Since some are being proposed for South Glendale, her neighborhood, and her neighbors are not happy.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Vice Chair Cartunian:</strong> The Vice Chair made several remarks.  His first point was that one size fits all doesn't work, with the limited car clearance example. His second point was regarding mentioning the City of Los Angeles in the letter as the reason being a limitation of authority, although noting to clarify that the property being discussed is in Glendale, but the impact is felt on Glendale residents crossing over into Los Angeles on the off-ramp from the 134.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> Commissioner Bartusek reminded members that the Foothill and Lowell in-and-out is just outside city limits, also generating traffic within Glendale.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Vice Chair Cartunian:</strong> Traffic study is needed there. People cross over the yellow lines when not interested in a drive-through. Police officers have seen it. Imploring them to address safety issues.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Chairperson Basemore:</strong> Chairperson Basemore also indicated having witnessed traffic congestion, stated appreciation for the detail incorporated in the letter, and expressed support for the letter as written.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> He pointed out that they did their due diligence and research to include what was possible, within reason. It's very difficult to address the impact that comes as a result of these establishments once they're approved. The most they could do, realistically, is hope police ticket drivers who are blocking traffic. There is already a pre-application for another in-and-out near Pacific and Verdugo, an area with residential streets nearby. He believed that all has been said.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> She asks about the potential to revoke the drive-through component of a restaurant if the traffic impact becomes a problem.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>David Nazarian:</strong> David Nazarian stated that staff would need to look at the conditions of approval. A revocation would be due to a pattern of violation of those conditions, in a due process hearing. He would have to think about whether there would be a violation of policies of circulation, and as opposed to a express condition that's attached to permit issuance. So it's something staff would have to look into.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Vice Chair Cartunian:</strong> Vice Chair Cartunian remarked that he found it hard to believe that the city has no enforcement mechanism. When doing infrastructure upgrades, permits and traffic plans are required to block a lane; in this case, the businesses are using a lane every day without pulling a permit. The city can and should sit down with the establishments and ask them to come up with a solution.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> The area in Grandview and Glenoaks, illustrates the degree to which Public Works is willing to work around a private use of public right of way. There is a specific establishment that is violating the approved circulation plan, however no action has been taken. Approving these establishments makes it very difficult to address the impacts that come as a result.

            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> Commissioner Werner, noted that it is the same problem: gas versus electric, as if encouraging gas, and needing to clarify. Should clarify current equipment. And do they have to turn that in?
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>David Nazarian:</strong> It's a buyback. If they're using current equipment. Turn that in?
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> She agreed, as long as it doesn't end up somewhere else.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> With South Coast AQMD, the gas equipment must be dismantled. But with Axa Voucher, it does not have to be done. They're able to purchase batteries with a voucher, but do the South Coast AQMD rebate with the leaf blower stack. This is a lot of rebates that are given.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Vice Chair Cartunian:</strong> Asked if the city has a database of large HOAs.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>David Nazarian:</strong> We have a list of HOAs, and the name of the Presidents and Vice Presidents.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Vice Chair Cartunian:</strong> The thought was to send a letter to those on the list.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> Also apartment building owners, where most do not know. I would like for people to know the neightborhood homeowners' council has been all over this for years.

            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> They've sent emails, and physical letters. Approached small businesses in specific bubbles.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Ex-Officio Khazaryan:</strong> Is there a record of how many such outreach events can occur?  How much of the financial aspect is still going to allow for this kind of vouchers to exist.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> Axa Steel Vouchers, are in process of getting more. A core program with a State Department has a small rebate coming in March. Only 6 million remaining. They do not have contact for that.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Ex-Officio Khazaryan:</strong> Instead of just giving the vouchers, doing the events to inform of the electric equipment, how it works, filling that aspect of the program.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> Axa brought in landscapers and equipment, so they wouldn't be able to repeat it exactly.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> I've been encouraging homeowners who hire gardeners, they should help bear the cost of it. These people are also screaming about noise.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Vice Chair Cartunian:</strong> He noted that council made the right decision to shift the burden of potential penalties on gas-powered equipment on the homeowners, and using the talking point. It should be directed toward homeowner, not the gardner.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Chairperson Basemore:</strong> The Chairperson suggested alternatives to leaf blowers.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> And 'No Mow,' is what you can do. You can be water wise, they have projects where, zero maintenance.  If the city can sponsor a 'Best' conversion to natural garden - not requiring mowing.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
