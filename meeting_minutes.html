                <strong>Commissioner B.:</strong> Commissioner B provided more information and background to the commission. He mentioned that after going through deliberation at the last Commission meeting, appropriate edits were made.

                <strong>Vice Chair Kartoonyan:</strong> Vice Chair Kartoonyan noted that one-size-fits-all does not work, as some establishments are busier than others, and some exceed the 500 ft queue, impeding the off ramp from the 134. Also he noted the need to include the caption that the images depict the City of LA.

    <h2>5. Letter from the Sustainability Commission for City Council's Consideration of New Drive-Through Regulations, Continued (Action)</h2>
    
        <p><em>Presented by Chairperson Bazemore</em></p>
    
    
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Motion that council address a street use permit mechanism and investigate a traffic circulation violation at Harvey and Wilson, and further that this topic be included in upcoming agenda items.</p>
    
    
        <p><strong>Comments:</strong></p>

            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Vice Chair Kartoonyan:</strong> I find it hard to believe that the city has no enforcement mechanism. If were doing construction at your house using a lane, you have to take a permit out, but they're not pulling permits to have drivers line up and spill onto the streets.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner B.:</strong> There is a report that city enforcement has brought the street use violations matter to the attention of building and safety, planning and In-N-Out but no action has been taken to address it. It's very hard to reverse the outcome after the business is approved. The only thing that is likely to occur is ticketing the individual drivers who are blocking the traffic, not the establishment, and we don't want to be going out ticketing the individuals who are waiting in line.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> Wondering if the city can revoke the drive through component if it doesn't manage traffic. I did ask around to some some different um members of my neighbor association and they're all um concerned about the impacts from these, so thank you for taking the lead on this.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>David A:</strong> Take a look at the conditions of approval, revocation would be based on established pattern of practice. A due process hearing has to be held.
            </li>
            
            <li class="comment">
                
                <strong>Vice Chair Kartoonyan:</strong> If the City Can come up with a plan for improvement with these Establishments. If given some kind of time frame from three to six months before pulling The Plug. On there Drive Thru.

                <strong>Commissioner B.:</strong> It’s less important whether it was unanimous or not. Also, if the first sentence is amended to say, the Sustainability Commission unanimously… and then I would add, with a parenthesis…Commissioner Pinkerton absent… parenthesis. Also I would clean up, would like to express, to express. Active language is more direct.

                <strong>Commissioner Barcusof:</strong> I’d like to ask that we agendize an action item for our next meeting to the effect of asking council to develop an incentive program for single use plastics, and if outside sources can’t be identified or secured, that the council allocated funding from our general budget or other local sources.

                <strong>David A:</strong> On December 5th, 2024, staff presented the commission with information on the 2024 work plan, including an overview of the commission's accomplishments for that year.

Each commissioner presented their proposed projects and the commission subsequently agreed to include all projects into the work plan.

                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> In regards to mobility and land use, i see vision zero and EV charging infrastructures. Those are two totally different bullet points, so those should be two separate bullet points since there's only one already listed.

                <strong>Commissioner Bartussif:</strong> And in that same box, I noticed and maybe its because we're thinking forward but the bicycle master plan is a component within Mobility and Land Use that hasn't been adopted by the council yet, so, I personally would add a bicycle master plan to category 2.

The Fire Department wants Plans that don’t even touch on what building components should be used to be most safe. Should there be more collaboration.
