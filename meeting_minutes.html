        <p><em>Presented by David A. City Staff</em></p>
    
    
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> The commission aims to submit a letter to the City Council supporting a re-evaluation of the prohibition on new drive-through establishments, initially raised at the January 13th meeting. The document has been revised, and is now ready for the commission to contemplate its submission to the City Council. David A. offers Commissioner Bartusek the opportunity to offer some background information to the Commission.</p>

                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> Reviewed the genesis and revisions made to the letter, which highlights the need to prevent problems as they are difficult to correct post-approval. He offered to walk through the exhibit examples

                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> Commended the incorporation of comments and the effective use of visuals to illustrate traffic issues and alley encroachments. She stated it doesn't seem like the rules are being enforced.

                <strong>Vice Chair Kartunian:</strong> Agreed with Commissioner Werner by mentioning the one-size-fits-all situation. The in and out traffic is backed up because the allowance does not fit all. I would mention on the letter that the out and in Q is in city of Los Angeles. It impedes 134 access.

                <strong>Vice Chair Kartunian:</strong> The City has seen it, the police know it, I ask them to address the safety issues.

                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> Harvy and Lowe location is outside of the City jurisdiction. That's right.

                <strong>Chairperson Basmajian:</strong> Noted the traffic on Harvey and Wilson extends onto the freeway ramp. He appreciates the information on the potential safety impacts, and he believes it is better to fix this problem while it is a situation that has not occurred as a major issue. This may be a cultural issue that the city should undertake.

                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> We should mention street use permit and see how this is affecting. It says we brought this to the building, safety and planning, but action has been taken.

                <strong>Commissioner Werner:</strong> There is something about a carry. It seems like we need to put a little more heat on this.

                <strong>Commissioner Bartusek:</strong> The image is Grand View and Glenn Oak. There is no way in there. I was trying to get a hold of, that situation where they work around with those streets, as a perfect reason to say that the city is being constructed to be around that street.. There should be construction. I can’t get to get into these private establishments.

    <h2>7. Sustainability Office Updates / Agza Outreach Update (Report)</h2>
    
        <p><em>Presented by Nora - City Staff</em></p>
    
    
        <p><strong>Summary:</strong> Azga outreach work in Glendale was conducted for a set number of times throughout December, with two crews working. The primary focus was on reaching out to communities, specifically those that had the highest complaints of leafblowers. A few community members also brought up how it gave them an amazing amount to work through as it was said it spread awareness to Spanish and English languages and information. The project was a success.</p>
