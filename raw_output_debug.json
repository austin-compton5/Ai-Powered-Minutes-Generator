Expressed that he cherishes relationship on this dais, Paula, and will miss you. Expressed confidence in the commission's future and ability to thrive. He thanked attorneys Nate Kowalski and Lucy Varbetian. Thanked Paula Adams for re-nominating me and told of times Paula would call me and say I think you were too hard.
