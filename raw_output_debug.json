The selection process includes an application evaluation, a professional panel interview with a tactical component, and a community internal panel interview. The job bulletin will be posted from June 30th through July 14th, 2025, with examinations tentatively scheduled for the week of August 18th, 2025. The eligible list will be valid for one year, consistent with Civil Service Rule 4, Section 17. The Glendale Management Association has reviewed the job bulletin and has not expressed any concerns. Ms. Adams respectfully recommended that the Commission approve the proposed job bulletin for Police Lieutenant as submitted.
