He asked the new mayor if they could impose stronger measures and declare a state of emergency to put a ban on cutting any trees. He mentioned that the mayor gave a wonderful reply but could not do it because of the charter. He asked the commission to see what is in their capacity to pass some kind of recommendations to the City Council. He stated that he is not so opposed to the form in the sense that the commission is approaching a certain complex but urgent situation with ecology, the fires, and developers. He stated that they may need to impose some stronger measures. He proposed that they need some kind of charismatic leader because the people will not awaken spontaneously. He concluded by stating that even FDR was making certain decisions bypassing Congress. He is not so opposed to having a kind of mayoral power that can do those decisions. He stated that commissions play a very significant role. He thinks that even the detractors of the environmental movement often claim there's too much of their influence. He would like to pause for a moment, and you are welcome to ask questions, but I would like to also go back to the charter review commission. But you see my point that we need stronger ecological measures. The only way to do it is with some kind of stronger leadership. Otherwise, our fate is some kind of a catastrophe maybe, but but we have to accept that fate and as it were work against it.",
