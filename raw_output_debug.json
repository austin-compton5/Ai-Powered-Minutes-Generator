The job bulletin aligns with the existing Police Lieutenant class specification, with some modifications requested by police management. A key addition is designating the Supervisory Leadership Institute (SLI) as a highly desirable qualification, but not required. Additional refinements were made to better articulate the skills, knowledge, and abilities expected for this management-level position. The selection process will mirror previous recruitments, including application evaluation, professional panel interview with a tactical component, and a community internal panel interview. With approval, the job bulletin will be posted from June 30th through July 14th, 2025. Examinations are tentatively scheduled for the week of August 18th, 2025. At the police department's request and consistent with Civil Service Rule 4 Section 17, the eligibility list from this recruitment will be valid for one year. The Glendale Management Association has reviewed the job bulletin and expressed no concerns. The recommendation is for the Commission to approve the proposed job bulletin for Police Lieutenant as submitted. A human resources analyst and a representative from police management are present to answer questions.",

If they are minor, grammatical, or more clearly state the essential functions, they don't take that information back. However, if it's substantial and it's going to change the requirements to compete or the design of the examination, then yes, they would have to go back and meet and confer with the union again.",
