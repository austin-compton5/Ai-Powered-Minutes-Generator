He asked the commission to see what is in their capacity to pass some kind of recommendations to the city council. He stated that he is not so opposed to the form, in the sense that we are approaching a complex but urgent situation with ecology, fires, and developers, and that we may need to impose some stronger measures. He stated that the way to do it is with some kind of charismatic leader, because the people will not awaken spontaneously. He concluded by stating that even FDR was making certain decisions bypassing Congress, and that he is not so opposed to having a kind of mayoral power that can do those decisions. He stated that commissions play a very significant role.",
